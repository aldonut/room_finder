There are two folders: old_method and screen_scrapper.

The old method is my first attemp, where I converted the HTML data into a text file and read/wrote to get elements. This took a lot time to format the actual text file in a way where I could read everything in its proper columns. 

screen_scrapper is a much faster and cleaner method which user jsoup to indivisually read html elements from a webpage store values. This method is much faster because the data is already orginized and ready to be travesed. 

The current DataExtraction.java is a work in progress. The initial connection has been tested, and values are read correctly. More optimization will follow.
